#download and transfer .faa files from IMG into appropriate project folders using cyberduck
#Create directory to hold/organize all of the .faa files. 
#within the working directory there needs to be the target .faa sequence file and the program file (code is that found and ran for the hmmsearch command)

#to open the correct environment to run the programs
  conda activate hgcAB
  
# need to use cd (change directory) to open to the correct folders containing necessary data to run program pipeline

# code for running the .faa files with the hmm hgcAB search command pipeline:
# example from running on bin 01 depth 10
# note: right clicking pastes copied code
   hmmsearch -E 1e-50 --tblout bin01_10-hgcA-hits.xls /data/home/mrpeter1/HgcAB/hgcA.hmm bin01_10.faa
   
   # note that the hgcA.hmm model needs to be accessible for the code to run, this pathway specifies that the hgcA.hmm model is in the directory HgcAB
   
#to convert .out files into more usable and readable csv and comma delineated files:
  bash ~/data/HgcAB/hmmscan_rough_parse.sh test.parse.out.csv
  
 #Note: the way that this command is written, it must be within the same folder as the .out file(s)
 #Note: if desired, if multiple .out files are within the same folder and the bash script is ran, it will compile all of the .out files and put them into a singular .csv
